## Contributing

Looking for the best way to contribute? Read this guide first.

### Found a bug?

If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help by [submitting an issue](CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-an-issue) to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/speculees/zod2form). Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

### Need a new feature?

If you need a new feature, you can help by [submitting a pull request](CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-pull-request) to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/speculees/zod2form).

## Submission guidelines

### Submitting an issue

Before you open an issue, please see the issue tracker. An issue of your problem may already exist and has been resolved, or a workaround may be found. If you can't find an existing issue, you can create a new one.

I want to help you with resolving the issue, but in order to do that, I need to be able to reproduce the issue. Please provide as much information as possible.

### Submitting a pull request

Please make sure the unit tests are passing. Make sure the code is formatted correctly. The commit messages should be clear and easy to understand see [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

```git
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]
```

For example:

```git
feat: add new feature
```

```git
fix: fix bug
```

```git
refactor: refactor code
```

```git
test: add unit tests
```
